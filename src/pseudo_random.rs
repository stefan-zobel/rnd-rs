//! This module provides a few different implementations of cryptographically **insecure** random
//! number generators suitable for numeric simulations.
//!
//! The default algorithm which is used in the thread-local generator [ThreadLocalPrng](ThreadLocalPrng) is
//! <a href=https://github.com/tylov/STC/blob/master/docs/crandom_api.md>Tyge Løvset's stc64 generator</a>
//! which is implemented in [Stc64](Stc64).
//!
//! Another fast high quality algorithm is <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.01407.pdf>Blackman and Vigna's (2019) xoshiro256**</a>
//! which is provided by [XoShiRo256StarStar](XoShiRo256StarStar).
//!
//! For applications that use tuples of consecutively generated values, it may be desirable
//! to use a generator that is k-dimensionally equidistributed such that k is at least as
//! large as the length of the tuples being generated.
//! The generator [Lcg64Xor1024Mix](Lcg64Xor1024Mix), which is a Rust port of Java's
//! <a href=https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/jdk.random/share/classes/jdk/random/L64X1024MixRandom.java>L64X1024MixRandom</a>
//! algorithm is provably 16-dimensionally equidistributed. This generator has a much larger
//! period (2<sup>64</sup>(2<sup>1024</sup>&minus;1)) and state space (1088 bits) than the
//! other generators and is about 3 to 4 times slower than [Stc64](Stc64).
//!
//! All of these algorithms have good performance in statistical tests and so far no major issues
//! are known. **None** of them is cryptographically secure. A weakness of the current implementation
//! is that all of them can only be seeded by a single `i64` which is theoretically insufficient
//! for the state space these generators have. However, this should hardly be detectable in actual
//! simulations.
